# Google Alert

A Python library for sending temperature alerts via Chromecast devices. This library provides the core functionality for monitoring temperature data stored in SQLite and broadcasting alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Features

- üì∫ **Chromecast Alerts**: Instant notifications via Chromecast devices
- üåô **Night Mode**: Suppress alerts during specified hours (e.g., 9 PM - 7 AM)
- ‚è∞ **Cooldown Period**: Prevent alert spam with configurable cooldown periods
- üîí **Process Safety**: File locking prevents overlapping monitoring processes
- üìä **SQLite Integration**: Works with temperature data stored in SQLite databases
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite covering all core functionality

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/emirkmo/google-alert.git
cd google-alert

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

**Set up monitoring alerts** (run via cron every minute):
```bash
python -m google_alert.monitor_chron /path/to/database.db
```

**Note**: This library focuses on the alerting functionality. For a complete temperature monitoring system including DHT sensor reading, see the [DHT22 Temperature Monitor](https://github.com/emirkmo/dht22_temp_monitor_google_alert/) repository, which includes the `temp_sensor.py` implementation and embedded Adafruit_DHT library.

## Configuration

### Monitor Settings

The monitor supports several command-line options:

```bash
python -m google_alert.monitor_chron database.db [options]

Options:
  -s, --threshold FLOAT    Temperature threshold in ¬∞C (default: 8.0)
  -c, --cooldown INT       Cooldown period in seconds (default: 3600)
  -w, --window INT         Time window in seconds for averaging (default: 60)
  -m, --message TEXT       Alert message (default: "Temperature below threshold")
  --night-start INT        Hour when night mode starts (0-23, default: 21)
  --night-end INT          Hour when night mode ends (0-23, default: 7)
```

### Example Cron Setup

Add to your crontab (`crontab -e`) to run monitoring every minute:

```bash
* * * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python -m google_alert.monitor_chron /path/to/database.db
```

## Architecture

### Core Modules

- **`monitor_chron.py`**: Main monitoring script that checks temperature averages and sends alerts
- **`sensor_db.py`**: Database operations for reading temperature data and managing alert history
- **`browser.py`**: Chromecast device discovery and message broadcasting

### Module Descriptions

#### `monitor_chron.py`
The core monitoring module that runs as a cron job. It:
- Queries average temperature from SQLite over a configurable time window
- Checks if temperature is below threshold
- Enforces cooldown periods to prevent alert spam
- Implements night mode to suppress alerts during specified hours
- Uses file locking to prevent overlapping runs
- Sends alerts via Chromecast when conditions are met

#### `sensor_db.py`
Database interface module that provides:
- SQLite database initialization with proper schema
- Temperature reading insertion and retrieval
- Alert history tracking for cooldown management
- Average temperature calculation over time windows

#### `browser.py`
Chromecast communication module that handles:
- Automatic discovery of Chromecast devices on the network
- Message broadcasting to all available devices
- Error handling for network and device communication issues

### Example Usage

The `temp_sensor.py` in the [DHT22 Temperature Monitor repository](https://github.com/emirkmo/dht22_temp_monitor_google_alert/) demonstrates how to use this library as part of a complete temperature monitoring system.

### Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with two main tables:

- **`readings`**: Stores temperature and humidity readings with timestamps
- **`alerts`**: Tracks alert history for cooldown management

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_monitor.py::TestMonitorMinute::test_night_time_alert_silencing -v
```

### Building the Package

```bash
# Build distribution packages
uv build

# The built packages will be in the dist/ directory
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Chromecast devices on the same network
- SQLite database with temperature readings

### Dependencies

- `orjson`: Fast JSON serialization
- `pychromecast`: Chromecast device communication

## Alert Logic

The system follows this decision tree for sending alerts:

1. ‚úÖ **Temperature Check**: Is average temperature below threshold?
2. ‚úÖ **Cooldown Check**: Has enough time passed since last alert?
3. ‚úÖ **Night Mode Check**: Is current time outside night mode hours?
4. ‚úÖ **Send Alert**: If all conditions are met, broadcast to Chromecast devices

## Night Mode

Night mode suppresses alerts during specified hours to avoid disturbing sleep. The default night window is 9 PM to 7 AM, but this can be customized via command-line options.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Chromecast devices found**: Ensure devices are on the same network and not in guest mode
2. **Database locked**: Check for multiple instances running simultaneously
3. **No temperature data**: Ensure your temperature sensor system is writing data to the SQLite database

### Logging

The system logs to syslog (LOCAL0 facility) by default. Check your system logs:

```bash
# On systemd systems
journalctl -f -u your-service

# On traditional systems
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep monitor_chron
```
